# Poppy-Seed

This is the little sibling (sister?) of the [Poppy Humanoid](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-humanoid) robot developed by the [Poppy Project](https://github.com/poppy-project) team.

At this moment it is in alpha stages and the only thing that can be promissed is that it doesn't catch fire in the first 2 hours of (very limited) operation. Those that are interesed to participate in the developement of this robot are more than wellcome, but I cannot stress ehough that things are not in a final form and most of the work involved is not trivial in nature. In time we expect certain items to be provided ready made instead of needing to hack them from scratch, therefore simplifying the construction.

## Prelimnary documentation
Before going into the details of the project design there are a few documents that make be useful to read.
* Torque and design: a document that explains the main assumption behind the belief that Poppy Seed will work
* High level design: the main design considerations for Poppy Seed
* 3D Printing guide: as one of the goals of Poopy Seed is to be printed on a home 3D printed, I included in this document the main tips about printers, materials, finishing and others
