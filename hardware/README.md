# Hardware

This section contains information about the hardware parts that are needed for the build of your Poppy Seed.

First have a look at the [BOM](BOM.md) file and make sure you understand all the parts that are needed. As this is a very early version of the robot some parts are custom-built. Some things are easy, but there are also parts that require soldering  and tools that you might not have laying around. So please take your time and read through the documents and understand what are the expectations <u>before</u> you place the orders for the materials needed.

If you plan to print the 3D parts youself read the document [3D Printing Guide] and make sure you understand the complexities of this process. If this is your first time in 3D printing I don't think it is a good idea to have Poppy Seed as your first project. A good knowledge of your 3D printer capabilities and limitations will save a lot of effort, time and money. The directory <b>"3D parts"</b> contain all the STLs that are needed. 

Once you have the parts you can start putting the robot together. The [Assembly guide](../docs/assembly) will walk you through this process, including the setup of the electronics.
