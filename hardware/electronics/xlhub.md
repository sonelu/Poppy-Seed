# Dynanmixel XL hub

Unlike the AX bus, there is no original [Robotis hub](http://www.robotis-shop-en.com/?act=shop_en.goods_view&GS=1398&GC=GD080300) that allows you to connect together several Dynanixel cables for XL bus. It is quite easy to put this together with a little bit of soldering skills.

You will need:
* a small prototyping board - preferrably one with stripes
* 5 MOLEX microblade board connectors

As tools you will need:
* a soldering iron
* solder
* small pliars
* a drill with a 4mm bit
* a hand saw (to trim the board)

The board as seen on the component face looks like this:
