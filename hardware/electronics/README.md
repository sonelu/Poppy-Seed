# Electronics

This section provides details about the custom or customised electronics used in Poppy Seed.

* [Hot-Swap board](hotswap.md): this boards are placed in the shins and they are used to control the power flow from the batteries to the Dynamixel bus allowing us to hot-swap the batteries
* [Custom HAT with Dynamxiel bus controller, power regultors and 9DOF IMU]: this HAT (board that fits on top a Raspberry Pi) is a temporary solution until Hipi becomes avaialable
* [Audio amplifier]:
* [Raspberry Pi on a diet]: this is a standard Raspberry Pi with the USB and Ethernet connectors removed and replaced with some simple JST 4-pin connectors. This reduces significatly the weight of the board and saves a lot of space for connectivitiy (since the USB connectors are extremely bulky for our need)
* [A custom USB adapter for dongles]
* [A custom USB cable - very short for the Dynamixel bus controller]
